Milestone 11: Fetch and Display Products üìù
Overview
In this milestone, we will implement an API endpoint to send all product data to the frontend. On the frontend, we will fetch this data and dynamically render it using the Product Card component.

Steps to Complete Milestone 11
Backend (API Endpoint)
Create a new API route in your backend server to fetch all product data.
Query the database to retrieve all products.
Send the product data as a JSON response.
Example (Node.js with Express & MongoDB)
app.get('/api/products', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const products = await Product.find();
        res.json(products);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error fetching products" });
    }
});
Frontend (Fetching Data & Displaying Products)
Write a function to fetch product data from the API.
Store the fetched data in a state variable.
Pass the data to the Product Card component and render it dynamically.
Example (React)
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import ProductCard from './ProductCard';

const ProductList = () => {
    const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

    useEffect(() => {
        const fetchProducts = async () => {
            try {
                const response = await fetch('/api/products');
                const data = await response.json();
                setProducts(data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
            }
        };

        fetchProducts();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            {products.map(product => (
                <ProductCard key={product._id} product={product} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default ProductList;
Product Card Component
Ensure that the ProductCard component correctly receives and displays the product data.

const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
    return (
        <div className="product-card">
            <h2>{product.name}</h2>
            <p>{product.description}</p>
            <p>Price: ${product.price}</p>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ProductCard;

        }
        const products = await Product.find({ userEmail: email });
        res.json(products);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: "Error fetching products" });
    }
});
Frontend (Fetching and Displaying User-Specific Products)
Write a function to fetch product data for the logged-in user.
Store the fetched data in a state variable.
Pass the data to the Product Card component and render it dynamically.

                setProducts(data);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Error fetching products:', error);
            }
        };

        if (userEmail) {
            fetchMyProducts();
        }
    }, [userEmail]);

    return (
        <div>
            {products.map(product => (
                <ProductCard key={product._id} product={product} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
};

export default MyProducts;
Product Card Component
Ensure that the ProductCard component correctly receives and displays the product data.

const ProductCard = ({ product }) => {
    return (
        <div className="product-card">
